# Mini Shopping Mall

This project is about to practice making the web application dynamic as data is stored in `JSON` file and `fetch` API fetches the file.

## UI

1. There is a logo that shows all the items when clicked
2. There are 6 different buttons that filter the items (i.e. filtered by tshirt, blue etc)
3. Items are presented under the buttons and the information of the items is stored in JSON file
